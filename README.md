# Marc Usher - Project 01

## Introduction
After looking at a number of past projects and researching some online/tabletop games, I decided to try and recreate 'Push Fight'.

'Push Fight' is a two-player board game, and there were a number of reasons why I thought it would be a good challenge for this first project:
* The game grid is relatively simple, but there are lots of conditions attached to that grid (not moving on empty space, not pushing off the barriers etc.)
* There are only a small number of pieces for each player, but there are multiple types of player piece each with different rules
* The rules themselves are simple but still a challenge to code the different turns, restrictions and victory conditions.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Flexbox
* JavasScript
* jQuery

## Idea Development
* [Trello Board with Wireframes & User Stories](https://trello.com/b/5KDX4WUr/ga-sei-64-project-1)
* I started by creating some User Stories (linked to above) to identify the most crucial features that a player would want when playing this game. This helped to decide on the priorities for the project, with some ideas being 'nice to have' but not essential to playing the game.
* I then created some mockups that would best serve these user stories and allow the game to be played easily.
* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.

### Dev Day 01
* I started by setting out the HTML for the main game area, thinking ahead to how I would need to manipulate/identify the various elements and also how I wanted to nest the elements in order to achieve the desired layout.
* I then worked on the CSS, setting properties that gave me the basic layout from my mockups. These properties weren't necessarily the final look for each element, but were added to allow me to easily identify each section of the page/board.
* I then worked on adding some basic pieces for each player, and researched & tested the jQuery functionality that would allow me to click and drag these pieces around the board. There were a few roadblocks during this part of the day, including: 
    * getting the pieces to snap to the squares on the grid
    * how the pieces overlap with each other
    * working out how to only allow the pieces to be moved to certain areas of the board
* Not all of these are solved as of the end of Day 01!

### Dev Day 02
* I started this day by reviewing yesterday's progress and updating my Trello board to track progress on the user stories.
* I also brainstormed the work that still needed to be done, going through the various parts of the code that would need to be added and worked through, and decided on how many of these points would be an achievable goal for today.
